# Inventory-Management-Project
Problem: The problem is to make inventory control more efficient, to avoid ant losses or unregistered expenses in convenience stores. The idea is to give continuity to the project previously generated in Python, but now implementing the use of classes and objects, using POO in C++. I also consider that this problem is important because it can help the growth of small and medium enterprises. Preventing that these take undetectable losses.

Project Description: In this project we will develop an inventory control software, which allows the user to save and delete products, update prices and record inputs and outputs of products, including sales and returns. In addition, a PDF report and a spreadsheet will be generated to store all inventory data.
