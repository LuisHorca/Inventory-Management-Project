# Inventory-Management-Project
Problem:
The problem is to make the inventory control more efficient, to avoid ant losses or unregistered expenses. The idea is to give continuation to the project previously generated in Python, but now implementing the use of classes and objects, using POO in C++. In the same way I think this problem is important because it can help the growth of small and medium companies.

Project Description:
In this project, an inventory control software will be developed, allowing the user to save and delete products, update prices, and record product entries and exits, including sales and refunds. Additionally, a PDF report and a spreadsheet will be generated to store the complete inventory data.
