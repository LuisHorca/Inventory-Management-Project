# Inventory-Management-Project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem: The problem is to make inventory control more efficient, to avoid ant losses or unrecorded expenses in convenience stores. In this case, the amount of products that one of these stores has was greatly simplified; in this case, we merely use 3 types of products, which are dairy, meat and canned goods. These will serve as subclasses of the product class.
The idea is to give continuity to the project previously generated in Python, but now implementing the use of classes and objects, using POO in C++. I also consider that this problem is important because it can help the growth of small and medium companies, preventing them from having undetectable losses.
----
Project Description: In this project we will develop an inventory control software, which allows the user to save and delete products, update prices and record inputs and outputs of products, including sales and returns. In addition, a PDF report and a spreadsheet will be generated to store all inventory data. Likewise, the UML diagram is incorporated at the end of this README.
